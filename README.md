# Subscription-Fatigue-Research-Project
This project investigates subscription fatigue through qualitative and quantitative research, applying EFA, segmentation, conjoint/MaxDiff, and logistic regression to uncover drivers of churn, segment behaviors, and key retention strategies.


## 1. Problem Definition

- **Management Decision Problem (MDP)**  
  How can subscription-based service providers reduce consumer fatigue and minimize churn?

- **Marketing Research Problem (MRP)**  
  1. What are the primary drivers of subscription fatigue?  
  2. Which factors most influence cancellation, retention, and re-subscription decisions?  
  3. How does the relative importance of subscription attributes (price, ads, content, bundles, cancellation ease, etc.) differ across user segments?  
  4. Can churn and retention behavior be predicted using demographic and psychographic variables?

## 2. Research Design

- **Qualitative Exploration**  
  - Netnography of online communities to capture consumer narratives about cancellations and subscription management.  
  - Open-ended survey questions to supplement insights.  

- **Quantitative Survey**  
  - Likert-scale items to measure attitudes, satisfaction, and fatigue indicators.  
  - Conjoint / MaxDiff tasks to measure attribute trade-offs and importance.  
  - Target sample: 200â€“400 respondents recruited online.

## 3. Data Preparation

- Data cleaning (remove incomplete/duplicate responses).  
- **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA):**  
  - Reduce multiple attitude/fatigue items into core latent dimensions (e.g., *price fatigue*, *content expectations*, *bundle reliance*).

## 4. Analysis Plan

1. **Segmentation Analysis**  
   - Cluster respondents based on factor scores and behavioral variables.  
   - Identify distinct user types (e.g., rotators, bundlers, ad-tolerant users, loyalists).  

2. **Conjoint / MaxDiff Analysis**  
   - Estimate utilities for subscription attributes (price tiers, ads, bundles, cancellation policy).  
   - Calculate relative attribute importance.  
   - Compare results across segments.  

3. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Dependent variable: subscription churn (0 = retain, 1 = cancel) or multinomial (retain, downgrade, cancel).  
   - Independent variables: factor scores, segment membership, conjoint utilities, demographics.  
   - Identify key predictors of churn and retention.

## 5. Expected Insights

- Structural factors of subscription fatigue.  
- User segments with distinct subscription management behaviors.  
- Attribute trade-offs that drive subscription decisions.  
- Predictive model for churn likelihood.  
- Strategic recommendations for providers to reduce fatigue and improve retention.
